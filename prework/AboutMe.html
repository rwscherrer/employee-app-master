		<h2 >About Ray</h2>
		<p>After 9 years of bean counting with the same company, I have decided to change my career and study web Development. While this is exciting, it has also presented numerous challenges. For instance, my class requiring the use of Macbooks. As a regular Microsoft user for the last 30 years I am relearning all the nuance that goes along with Apple products. The last Apple product I used, an Apple IIe, was in 1984 while attending grade school.

		<p>My previous role was as <i><b>Revenue Assurance Manager</b></i> for telecommunications provider. The role was a blend of both IT and Finance, and relied heavily on my ability to pull data from various systems. 
		</P>

		<p>I am an avid live music fan and I have attended well over 1000 concerts all over the country. I recently built a media server to host my collection of audio and video recordings of concerts.
